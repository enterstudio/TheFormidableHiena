Why is this blog named after hyenas? They are my favorite animal. They are badass, the real deal. 

Hyenas are more than the carrion-eating villains of The Lion King. Though you may not ever fall in love with these cunning animals, it’s hard not to respect them.

## 1. A HYENA’S LAUGH INDICATES SOCIAL STATUS.

Hyenas don’t just laugh for fun. Scientists say that the pitch and the note frequency (or tone) of a hyena’s laugh can give an [indication of its age and social status](http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8593000/8593789.stm).

## 2. HYENAS ARE SMARTER THAN CHIMPS.

The size of an animal's frontal cortex is believed to be connected to its social intelligence, and hyenas have a frontal cortex on par with primates. A study done by Duke University showed that a captive pair of hyenas performed better at problem-solving and social cooperation than chimpanzees. Even more amazing is that during the study, the hyenas solved all the problems in silence, using [only non-verbal signals for communication](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090928131032.htm).

## 3. THEY KILL BABY LIONS.

Hyenas and lions often fight over the same territories and hunt the same prey. This leads to fierce competition between the two animals. They steal each other’s food and kill off the [young of their enemies](http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/media/lions-vs-hyenas-competing-interests/?ar_a=1).

## 4. SPOTTED HYENAS ARE CUNNING KILLERS.

Despite what Simba would have you believe, spotted hyenas don’t just scavenge for lion leftovers. Spotted hyenas hunt and kill in packs. [Ninety-five percent](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/whos-laughing-now-38529396/?no-ist=) of what a hyena eats comes from hunting. A group of hyenas can devour an entire zebra, leaving no leftovers—not even the bones — [in under half an hour](http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/hyenas-laugh.htm). However, this feeding frenzy comes at a cost; hyenas rip, claw, and fight with one another over the remains of their meal.

Of course, striped hyenas are a different story. Striped hyenas live off of carrion and are often hit by vehicles [while eating road kill](http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/striped-hyena).

## 5. FEMALE HYENAS RULE.

Female spotted hyenas are more muscular and more aggressive than their male counterparts. This is because the females have three times as much testosterone in their bodies. As a result, [spotted hyena societies are matriarchal](http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/wild-kingdom/about-animals/hyena-facts/). Even baby girl cubs rule over the boys.

## 6. THE FEMALE SPOTTED HYENA HAS A PENIS.

Female spotted hyenas have a pseudo-penis that is basically an [elongated clitoris](http://tvblogs.nationalgeographic.com/2014/01/10/worlds-weirdest-giving-birth-through-a-penis/). Some pseudo-penises can grow up to seven inches long, totally besting the average length of the human penis.

## 7. THE LIFE OF A BABY HYENA ISN'T EASY.

The female spotted hyena uses her pseudo-penis for urination, copulation, and birth, which can make the birthing process difficult—it’s estimated that [60 percent of hyena cubs die from suffocation](http://tvblogs.nationalgeographic.com/2014/01/10/worlds-weirdest-giving-birth-through-a-penis/). (It's dangerous for the mothers, too; the baby cubs can tear the pseudo-penis lining, an injury that can prove fatal.) Those that do survive face several hardships of their own: Female hyenas have only two nipples, so litters of more than two have to fight to survive, leaving the weakest cubs to [die of starvation](http://blog.sfgate.com/pets/2008/05/23/the-hyena-gets-new-spots/). 

## 8. THEY HAVE CREEPY GREETING CEREMONIES.

When a spotted hyena greets another hyena after a long separation, they engage in [greeting ceremonies](http://www.hyaenidae.org/hyena-myths.html) during which both male and female members of the species develop erections.

## 9. BEING A MALE SPOTTED HYENA IS HARD.

In women-dominated spotted hyena clans, adult males are the lowest of the low. When the male hyena reaches sexual maturity at the age of two, he leaves home and goes to find a new group. This is a violent and vicious process. When the new group's alpha female finally allows the male in, he is welcomed by being constantly harassed and forced to [struggle for food and sex](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/whos-laughing-now-38529396/?all).

## 10. HYENAS ARE DIFFICULT TO TAME.

Historians theorized that ancient Egyptians domesticated striped hyenas and used them as a food source. In ancient hieroglyphics, hyenas are often depicted in subordinate positions, being hunted and tamed. But in a 2010 paper published in the [International Journal of Osteoarchaeology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oa.1168/full), A. J. Legge surmises that this was all just Egyptian pomp. Because the striped hyena lives off of carrion, they would make for a terrible meal (what with all that trichinosis). Legge concludes that while hyenas may have been tamed for a period, it didn’t last long.

## 11. MOST OF THE MYTHS SURROUNDING HYENAS ARE JUST THAT.

[Sordid myths and legends](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0506/feature3/learn.html) about hyenas abound. In Tanzania and India, legend holds that witches ride hyenas. An Ethiopian folk religion tells of people who possess the evil eye and can change themselves into the creatures. In the Middle Ages, hyenas were believed to dig up and consume the bodies of the dead. (It’s worth noting that they do nothing of the sort.)

## 12. HEMINGWAY HATED HYENAS.

Given their reputations as scavengers—and their creepy laughs—it makes sense that plenty of people don’t like hyenas. In Green Hills of Africa, Ernest Hemingway wrote:

> Fisi, the hyena, hermaphroditic self-eating devourer of the dead, trailer of calving cows, ham-stringer, potential biter-off of your face at night while you slept, sad yowler, camp-follower, stinking, foul, with jaws that crack the bones the lion leaves, belly dragging, loping away on the brown plain …

Hemingway: 1, Hyenas: 0.
