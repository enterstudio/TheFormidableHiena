# XILFFS - This page provides details related to the xilffs library.

*  The LibXil fat file system (FFS) library consists of a file system and a glue layer. This FAT file system can be used with an interface supported in the glue layer.
*  The file system code is open source and is used as it is. Glue layer implementation supports SD/eMMC interface presently.
*  Application should make use of APIs provided in ff.h. These file system APIs access the driver functions through the glue layer.
